A tool that monitors smart contracts activity and interactions by scanning transactions in the blockchain.
## Using the tool

## How it works
Smart-contract-watch reports two diffrent activities conducted by a smart contract using [getTransaction](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JavaScript-API#web3ethgettransaction) , [getTransactionReceipt](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JavaScript-API#web3ethgettransactionreceipt)

1. Direct transactions conducted from or to the monitored smart contracts. This is done by scanning the `to`, `from` fields in all transactions and reporting them back.
2. Log events generated by the monitored smart contract. This is helpful when scanning for internal transactions/activity not directly conducted by the monitored smart-contract.
